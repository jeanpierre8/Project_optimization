# Project_optimization

Project Group Done with 3 other students

This project will allow us to show our understanding of the different
concepts discovered in class and use those knowledge to solve concrete problems.

The goal is to maximize the grades of the students in the dataset. And use different machine learning 
models, then make a comparison between those models and finally the results and the response to our problem.
